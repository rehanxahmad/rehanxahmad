### 🧠 About Me

🎯 I'm a process-focused engineer with 3+ years of experience in driving workflow optimization, defect reduction, and performance analysis using Lean Six Sigma methodology.  

⚙️ I’m passionate about **using technology to eliminate inefficiencies**, streamline operations, and build intelligent systems. Whether it's automating tasks with Python, optimizing cloud workflows, integrating mobile-based triggers, or designing scalable solutions. I enjoy solving problems that blend logic, creativity, and impact.

🧪 I believe in building solutions that are not just functional, but meaningful, automating what should be automated, optimizing what should be improved, and simplifying what should be understood.
