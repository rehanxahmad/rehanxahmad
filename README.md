### 🧠 About Me

🎯 I'm a process-focused engineer with 3+ years of experience in driving workflow optimization, defect reduction, and performance analysis using Lean Six Sigma methodology.  

⚙️ I’m passionate about **using technology to eliminate inefficiencies**, streamline operations, and build intelligent systems. Whether it's automating tasks with Python, optimizing cloud workflows, integrating mobile-based triggers, or designing scalable solutions. I enjoy solving problems that blend logic, creativity, and impact.

💻 Currently building projects in:
- Serverless architecture (AWS Lambda, API Gateway)
- Self-hosted infrastructure (VPN, DNS, Pi-hole)
- Mobile integrations and lightweight workflow automation
- Cloud cost optimization and task orchestration

🧪 I believe the best systems aren't just functional — they're intelligent, secure, and empowering.
