### 🧠 About Me

🎯 I'm a process-focused engineer with 3+ years of experience in driving workflow optimization, defect reduction, and performance analysis using Lean Six Sigma methodology.  

🚀 I recently ventured into cloud automation and successfully built a **one-tap mobile solution to control AWS EC2 instances** using **Lambda, API Gateway, IAM, and Android** — combining my core strength in efficiency with modern cloud tooling.

🧪 I enjoy solving problems at the intersection of operations, automation, and self-learning.
